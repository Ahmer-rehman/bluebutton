Hello, bigbluebutton developers. I am so sorry for bothering you.
I need to solve this problem urgently, so if you want, I can fund you to fix this problem.

I need assistance in integrating BBB into my LMS system. I configured the layout to build the recorded video as follows when the screen and webCam (1) are shared at the same time during the recording process.

bigbluebutton\record-and-playback\video\scripts\video.yml

layout:
  width: 1280
  height: 720
  framerate: 24
  areas:
    - name: presentation
      x: 0
      y: 0
      width: 1280
      height: 720
    - name: webcam
      x: 0
      y: 0
      width: 1280
      height: 720    
    - name: deskshare
      x: 0
      y: 0
      width: 1280
      height: 720    
      pad: true      
    - name: webcam
      x: 960
      y: 500
      width: 270
      height: 200


When using this layout, if both the screen and webCam are shared during the recording process, the video is recorded in the same structure as screen1 as follows.

When using this layout, if both the screen and webCam are shared during the recording process, the screen sharing layout (full-screen) and webCam layout (small) are displayed in the video like the screen1.png file.

However, even when screen sharing is disabled, the webCam layout (full-screen) and webCam layout (small) are displayed in the video like the screen2.png file.

I don't want to present a small webCam layout in this case.
I would really appreciate any help I need in this regard.

I sincerely look forward to your help.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards.
