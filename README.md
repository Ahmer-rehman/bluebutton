BigBlueButton
=============
BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system for online learning.  

We believe that every student with a web browser should have access to a high-quality online learning experience.  

BigBlueButton supports real-time sharing of audio, video, slides (with annotations), chat, slides, and screen.  Instructors can engage students with polls, emojis, and breakout rooms.  BigBlueButton can record and playback all content shared in a session.

The use cases for BigBlueButton are

  * One-to-one on-line tutoring
  * Small group collaboration 
  * On-line classes

The BigBlueButton server runs under Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit.  Using packages provided by the project, the overall time for setting up a new server should be about 30 minutes.
